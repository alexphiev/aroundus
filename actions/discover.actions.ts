    TRANSPORT & ACCESSIBILITY:
    - Consider destinations that are accessible via ${getTransportDescription(
      validatedData.transportType
    )}
    - Factor in parking availability, public transport stops, or bike-friendly routes as appropriate
    - Account for the practicality of reaching the destination with the chosen transport method
    - For walking/biking: suggest closer destinations and consider trail access points
    - For public transport: ensure destinations are near transit stops or accessible via transit
    - For car travel: consider parking availability and road accessibility
    
    TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Please consider the visit date for seasonal activities, weather patterns, and accessibility
    - Account for weekend vs weekday crowd levels and suggest timing accordingly
    - Consider any potential public holidays or local events that might affect crowds
    - Recommend seasonal activities appropriate for the time of year
    - Factor in weather conditions typical for this season in the region
    
    CURRENT WEATHER FORECAST:
    ${weatherData}
    
    WEATHER-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - Use the weather forecast above to suggest activities suitable for the predicted conditions
    - For rainy weather: prioritize indoor attractions, covered areas, or activities that work well in rain
    - For sunny weather: suggest outdoor activities and recommend sun protection
    - For cold weather: suggest activities with warming options or shorter outdoor exposure
    - For hot weather: recommend activities with shade, water features, or early morning/evening timing
    - Consider wind conditions for activities like cycling, photography, or water sports
    - Factor in precipitation chances when recommending specific times of day
    - Adjust activity duration recommendations based on weather comfort levels
    
    CRITICAL: You must strictly adhere to the duration criteria. For activity duration of ${validatedData.activityDurationValue} ${validatedData.activityDurationUnit}:
    - If specified in hours: suggest activities that take between ${Math.max(
      1,
      validatedData.activityDurationValue - 1
    )} and ${validatedData.activityDurationValue + 1} hours
    - If specified in days: suggest activities that take between ${Math.max(
      1,
      validatedData.activityDurationValue - 1
    )} and ${validatedData.activityDurationValue + 1} days
    
    For travel distance preference of ${validatedData.distance} via ${getTransportDescription(
      validatedData.transportType
    )}:
    - Suggest places that fall within the user's preferred travel time range: ${validatedData.distance} from ${locationName} (coordinates: ${validatedData.location.latitude}, ${validatedData.location.longitude}) using ${getTransportDescription(
      validatedData.transportType
    )}
    - Understand this as a range preference, not a strict maximum - the user wants destinations that match their ideal travel time
    - For "less than" ranges: prioritize closer destinations but can include places up to that time
    - For "between" ranges: focus on destinations that fall within that specific time window
    - Use Google Search to verify actual travel times from the starting location to match the user's distance preference
    - Consider realistic routes, traffic patterns, and connections for the chosen transport method
    - Factor in any transport-specific limitations (bike paths, transit schedules, parking requirements)
    
    ACTIVITY FOCUS: Prioritize locations and experiences that align with "${validatedData.activity}" activities.

    🌿 NATURE-ONLY VALIDATION: Before suggesting any place, verify it is 100% natural and outdoor-focused. Reject any place that has primarily artificial, commercial, or indoor elements.
    
    For each NATURAL suggestion, provide these details:
    - name: A catchy and descriptive name for the NATURAL spot/activity (emphasize natural features)
    - description: A brief, engaging description (2-3 sentences) highlighting the NATURAL elements, outdoor activities, and how to get there. Focus on trees, water, rocks, wildlife, natural terrain, and scenic beauty.
    - lat: The precise latitude of the starting point of the activity (use Google Search to find exact coordinates with full precision, e.g., 40.594721)
    - long: The precise longitude of the starting point of the activity (use Google Search to find exact coordinates with full precision, e.g., -4.156937)
    - landscape: Must be ONE of these NATURAL categories: "mountain", "forest", "lake", "beach", "river", "park", "wetland", "desert"
    - activity: Must be ONE of these NATURE activities: "hiking", "biking", "camping", "photography", "wildlife", "walking", "swimming"
    - estimatedActivityDuration: The estimated time range for the outdoor activity (e.g., "1-4 hours", "2-3 days")
    - estimatedTransportTime: The estimated one-way travel time from starting location (e.g., "45 minutes", "2 hours")
    - transportMode: The primary transport mode used (must be one of: "foot", "bike", "public_transport", "car")
    - starRating: Rate from 1-3 stars based on how well this NATURAL destination fulfills the user's specific request (3 = perfect match and must-go, 2 = very good match, 1 = good option but less ideal)
    - starRatingReason: A comprehensive explanation (2-3 sentences) combining both why you recommend this NATURAL place and why you gave it this specific star rating. Explain how well it matches the user's criteria (activity type, distance, duration, special requirements), highlight the place's natural qualities and outdoor features, and justify the rating based on overall fit and natural beauty
    - bestTimeToVisit: Recommended time range for optimal OUTDOOR experience based on the weather forecast and crowds (e.g., "8:00 AM - 11:00 AM before rain starts", "early morning when clear skies", "afternoon after 2 PM when temperatures cool")
    - timeToAvoid: Times or conditions to avoid for OUTDOOR activities (e.g., "midday during rain", "weekends 10 AM-4 PM", "avoid if temperature below 5°C")
    
    CRITICAL: For coordinates, use Google Search to find the exact latitude and longitude of each NATURAL location. 
    Provide coordinates with full precision (6 decimal places minimum) - do not round or truncate them.
    
    CRITICAL: Every single suggestion MUST be a natural outdoor place. If you cannot find 4 natural places that meet the criteria, return fewer suggestions rather than including non-natural places.
    
    CRITICAL: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO additional text, explanations, introductions, or markdown formatting.
    Start your response immediately with [ and end with ].

      ${baseCriteria}
      
      Focus on finding diverse, high-quality NATURAL destinations around ${locationName} that offer authentic outdoor and nature experiences. 
      Mix different types of natural landscapes (mountains, forests, lakes, etc.) to provide variety.
      Prioritize places where people can directly experience and interact with natural environments.
      
      NATURE EXPERIENCE FOCUS: Every suggestion must provide direct contact with natural elements - trees, water, rocks, wildlife, natural terrain, fresh air, and natural beauty.
      
      LOCATION CONTEXT: The user is starting from ${locationName}, so suggest natural destinations that make sense geographically from this location.
      
      ${
        currentContext.previousPlaces.length > 0
          ? `
      🚨 CRITICAL: This is batch ${batchNumber}. You MUST avoid suggesting places that are:
      - Within 10km of any previously suggested location
      - Similar in type, characteristics, or experience to previous recommendations
      - Variations or alternate routes of places already suggested
      
      MANDATORY DIVERSITY: Each new recommendation must be genuinely different and offer a completely unique experience.`
          : ''
      }
      
      RANKING CRITERIA:
      Rate each destination 1-3 stars based on how well it fulfills the user's specific request:
      - 3 stars: Perfect match for user's request, must-go destination that exactly meets their criteria
      - 2 stars: Very good match, strongly aligns with user's preferences 
      - 1 star: Good option that meets basic criteria but may be less ideal for this specific request
      
      Consider the user's activity preferences, timing, distance, transport method, and especially their additional search info when rating.
      
      🚨 FINAL NATURE-ONLY VERIFICATION:
      Before generating your response, double-check that EVERY suggestion is:
      ✅ A natural outdoor environment (forests, mountains, lakes, beaches, rivers, etc.)
      ✅ Provides direct contact with nature elements (trees, water, rocks, wildlife, natural terrain)
      ✅ Offers outdoor activities in natural settings
      ❌ NOT artificial, commercial, urban, or primarily man-made
      ❌ NOT museums, pools, zoos, theme parks, or indoor attractions
      
      If any suggestion doesn't meet these nature criteria, REPLACE it with a different natural place.
      
      Return exactly 4 NATURAL destinations.
